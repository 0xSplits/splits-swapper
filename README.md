# splits-swapper

## What

TODO [Docs]

Swapper is a module that trustlessly & automatically converts multi-token revenue into a single token.

## Why

This is a missing fundamental building block of several future e2e products in the splits ecosystem.

## Notes

Please be aware, a swapper's owner has _FULL CONTROL_ of the deployment.

## Lint

`forge fmt`

## test

`forge test` - compile & test the contracts

`forge t -vvv` - produces a trace of any failing tests
